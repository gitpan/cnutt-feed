Cnutt-feed

Description
===========

This software is part of the Cnutt project which aims to provide a set
of tools for all mail related operations. Actually, this is only the
first release of this project and it's not likely to change soon.

Cnutt-feed is (another) RSS/Atom feed to mailbox converter. Given a feed,
it is able to present it as email messages.

The main difference with the other existing tools is that cnutt-feed
does not rely on a smtp server to deliver messages (like rss2email) or
on an imap server (like feed2imap). It is able to directly delivers the
messages to all the mailboxes supported by the perl module
Email::LocalDelivery.

Moreover, it uses a human readable (and writable) configuration file
and stores all relevant information about the feed in the mailbox itself
(no need for a database or a separated cache file).
